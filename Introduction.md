## Introduction 
At our time and age, it is really hard to find a problem where machine learning is not already applied -- machine learning is practically everywhere, in business applications and science.
So why not make our one. 
Machine learning in any form, including pattern recognition, has of course many uses from voice and facial recognition to medical research.
In this case, our question is whether or not we can use pattern recognition to reference previous situations that were similar in pattern.
If we can do that, can we then make trades based on what we know happened with those patterns in the past and actually make a profit?


In following chapters we will be completely code everything ourselves. We're only going to need Matplotlib (for data visualization) and some NumPy (for number crunching), and the rest is up to us.

Pip is probably the easiest way to install packages Once you install Python, you should be able to open your command prompt, like cmd.exe on windows, or bash on linux, and type:

## Installing packages using pip
* `pip install numpy`
* `pip install matplotlib`
